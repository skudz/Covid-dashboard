# Covid-19 Dashboard 
## Introduction
This project creates a COVID-19 dashboard with up-to-date 
information of current covid levels and relevant news related to the pandemic. 
The numeric data shown on the dashboard will be the total 7-day cases in your local area along 
with a separate 7-day total for national data, the current hospital admissions and the total number
of deaths in your country. On the right-hand side of the dashboard will be a widget containing the 
latest news that relates to COVID-19; and on the left and lower centre there is a scheduling widget 
for you to create update schedules so that the data shown on the dashboard will update at a given interval.
